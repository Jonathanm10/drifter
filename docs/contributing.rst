Before publishing your contributions please test your roles with the
playground. To do so, go to the ``playground`` directory, enable any
role you need in ``playbook.yml`` and set any parameter you want in
``parameters.yml`` and then run ``vagrant up``. The box will use the
roles of your working copy.

Please don't commit any change to the playground, unless you're fixing
something in the playground.
