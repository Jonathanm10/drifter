The future ?
============

The framework will evolve as we use it on more projects. It is not the
goal to refrain you from doing anything. It will be improved as we need
it, the goal is to serve Liip teams !

What could be done if the need arise :

-  Better installer with questions to automatically create the config
   files instead of manual editing
