Drifter
=======

Drifter is a framework to help provision developer boxes using Ansible
and Vagrant.



Goals
-----

-  Streamline our project setups
-  Ease the "entry cost" for a new squad member
-  Easy to use
-  Lean: small codebase, easy to maintain and extend, focus only on
   Debian and Ubuntu
-  Be adopted by Liip as a whole

The idea behind the framework
-----------------------------

The idea is to have a common ground for each project that can be
improved over time, each project benefiting from the improvements.

This repository aims to contain multiples Ansible roles to manage the
various part of the development stack needed to work on the various
projects of Liip. If a someone need new roles, it is highly recommended
that they are added to the common pool if they are deemed reusable.

Each squad can tailor its box to its need by modifying the Ansible
playbook which should ultimately only contain role inclusion to maximize
reuse.

When installed, Drifter creates a parameters file to hold various
information about your project, a playbook file where you can choose
what to install and finally a Vagrantfile where you can modify some
Vagrant related parameters before the "main" Vagrantfile is included.
This should offer enough flexibility for every project.

What this framework is not ?
----------------------------

This framework does not aim to provide a way to deploy staging and
production servers for your project. The roles are written with a
development box in mind and are thus not fit for server provisioning.
There are absolutely no security issues taken into consideration.

However, if your server is using a Debian based OS based on the stable
release, both configurations should be close enough so that you won't
run into issues.

Intended Public
---------------

This project was first and foremost created to be used inside of Liip,
but you are more than welcome to use it for personal projects or
anywhere else you'd like to.

Requirements
============

-  Vagrant >= 1.8.4
-  Git >= 1.0

You also need a virtualization solution, either one of these:

-  Virtualbox >= 4.3
-  LXC >= 1.0 & vagrant-lxc >= 1.0.0.alpha.2

Optional dependencies:

-  `vagrant-hostmanager <https://github.com/devopsgroup-io/vagrant-hostmanager>`__
   A Vagrant plugin that manages /etc/hosts files. (will be
   automatically used if installed, make sure it's at least 1.5.0 if you
   have it)
-  `vagrant-cachier <https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-cachier>`__ A
   Vagrant plugin that share common package cache among similar VM
   instances.

Install Requirements
--------------------

Debian Stretch (testing) and Ubuntu Xenial 16.04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open a terminal and run::

    sudo apt-get install vagrant vagrant-lxc vagrant-cachier
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager

Older Debian and Ubuntu versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go to https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html to download and install
the latest Vagrant version. Then open a terminal and run::

    sudo apt-get install lxc redir    # this is needed for LXC provider
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-lxc vagrant-cachier vagrant-hostmanager

Mac OS X
~~~~~~~~

Download and install
`https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html <the%20latest%20Vagrant%20version>`__.

Download and install
`https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads <the%20latest%20VirtualBox%20version>`__.

Then open a terminal and run::

    vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier vagrant-hostmanager

You can also use ``cask`` to help with the installation:::

    brew cask install vagrant virtualbox

Windows
~~~~~~~

Install Virtualbox and Vagrant (>= 1.8.4) using the binaries available
on their respective websites.

Also make sure that ``core.autocrlf`` is set to ``input`` (recommended)
or at least ``true`` so that you don't get issues with Windows
line-endings in the files that are in your box. You can set it by
running the following command:

``git config --global core.autocrlf input``

For example if you get the following error when trying to provision the
box::

    TASK [base : ensure base packages are installed] *******************************

    failed: [default] (item=[u'locales', u'procps', u'command-not-found', u'bash-completion', u'zsh', u'bzip2', u'unzip', u'vim', u'ack-grep', u'highlight', u'libxml2-utils', u'build-essential', u'wget', u'openssh-server', u'sudo', u'imagemagick', u'iputils-ping', u'ncurses-term', u'python-pycurl']) => {"failed": true, "item": ["locales", "procps", "command-not-found", "bash-completion", "zsh", "bzip2", "unzip", "vim", "ack-grep", "highlight", "libxml2-utils", "build-essential", "wget", "openssh-server", "sudo", "imagemagick", "iputils-ping", "ncurses-term", "python-pycurl"], "module_stderr": ">>> /etc/sudoers.d/sudo-passwordless: syntax error near line 1 <<<\nsudo: parse error in /etc/sudoers.d/sudo-passwordless near line 1\nsudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting\nsudo: unable to initialize policy plugin\n", "module_stdout": "", "msg": "MODULE FAILURE", "parsed": false}

That's because the sudoers file that gets copied in the box has the
wrong format. Enabling ``core.autocrlf`` will fix the issue.

Usage
=====

Drifter is going to be installed into your project as a git submodule.
So if your project is not using Git as VCS, start by creating a git
repo::

    cd my-project && git init

Then to install Drifter, simply run the following command::

    curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liip/drifter/master/install.sh | /bin/bash

This will create a ``Vagrantfile`` in your root and a ``virtualization``
folder containing configuration files. You now have to follow those two
steps:

-  edit ``virtualization/parameters.yml`` to set parameters related to
   your project
-  edit ``virtualization/playbook.yml`` to configure what to install in
   your box

You now just have to launch your Vagrant box and start hacking!::

    vagrant up

Customization
-------------

You can customize what seems to us to be the most important options
through two files:

-  ``virtualization/parameters.yml`` for all project related parameters.
   Any value in this file will be passed to Ansible as a variable. You
   can override any role default values through this file. You can find
   details about possible parameters and values later in this
   documentation.

-  ``virtualization/playbook.yml`` for provisioning. You can control
   which roles are used to build your box. This allows you to control
   what is installed in your box.

If those two mechanisms are not enough for you, you can also modify the
``Vagrantfile``, but be aware that the risk of botching things up is far
greater.

Currently you do not have a lot of control, but we will glad to add
anything making sense to this file. Feel free to ask and we will comply
;)

Contributing
------------

Before publishing your contributions please test your roles with the
playground. To do so, go to the ``playground`` directory, enable any
role you need in ``playbook.yml`` and set any parameter you want in
``parameters.yml`` and then run ``vagrant up``. The box will use the
roles of your working copy.

Please don't commit any change to the playground, unless you're fixing
something in the playground.
